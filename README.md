Unofficial, Linkml Classes and Properties characterizing [The Collections Ontology (CO)](https://github.com/collections-ontology/collections-ontology)

> **Two ways in.** This README is one; the other is a docent, a museum's name
> for a guide. Install
> [`ktl-docent`](https://github.com/noelmcloughlin/knowledge-trust-ladder) into
> whatever agent you already use, by a route from
> [the install page](https://w3id.org/ktl/docs/install/), and ask it anything
> about this project. It answers from `.lokf/knowledge/`,
> the checked part of what the project knows, and says how far each answer has
> been trusted (still a draft, checked by automation only, or confirmed by a
> named person). It opens the source for exact values, and records what it
> could not answer so the gap gets filled. The same docent serves a person at a
> prompt, an agent reading this file, or a chatbot that can load a skill.
> **Agents:** if `.lokf/knowledge/index.md` exists, read it first. `llms.txt`
> says how to weigh it.
